# How to Add This Project to a GitHub Repository

This guide provides the step-by-step instructions to upload your project code to a new GitHub repository.

Follow these instructions from your local machine's command line or terminal. You must have `git` installed.

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1.  Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2.  Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.
3.  Give your repository a name (e.g., `sih-krishimitra-prototype`).
4.  Choose whether to make it public or private.
5.  **Important**: Do **not** initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license file, as this project already contains them.
6.  Click **"Create repository"**.

## Step 2: Push Your Existing Code from the Command Line

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with commands. You will use the "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line" option.

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate into your project's root folder, and run these commands one by one.

1.  **Initialize a git repository in your project folder:**
    ```bash
    git init -b main
    ```

2.  **Add all your project files to be tracked:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Commit the files (save a snapshot of your project):**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Initial commit of KrishiMitra prototype"
    ```

4.  **Link your local repository to the one on GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    ```
    **Important:** Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and the repository name you chose in Step 1. You can copy this exact URL from the GitHub page.

5.  **Push your code to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

After these steps are complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You will see all of your project files there, ready for you to share or continue working on.
